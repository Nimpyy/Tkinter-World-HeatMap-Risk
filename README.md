## Tkinter-World-HeatMap-Risk

This is my first attemp in creating an app and an introductory project on development. The aim of this mini project was to produce a simple user-interface to visualize the results of a research on a world cyber risk heatmap. Later in the process different risks were added such as "physical security" and "gouvernment surveillance". 

The user can select the risk they want to visualize as well as the score details of one or two countries by ticking the "Comparaison" button and selecting the countries of interest in the droplist. 

The countries' details include the sources and their respective score given to the selected country. The colours on the map are determined by the sum of the scores of all sources for a country for given risk. Each risk has its own scale displayed alongside the heatmap.

The code was written on Visual Studio Code. 
The app was created using tkinter, pandas, geopandas and matplotlib.
